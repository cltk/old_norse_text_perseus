But the thrall took to loathing his work, and got more grumbling and heedless than he was wont heretofore: his part it was to watch the fire night by night, and Grettir gave him good warning thereon, for no boat they had with them.Now so it befell that on a certain night their fire went out; Grettir was wroth thereat, and said it was but his due if Noise were beaten for that deed; but the thrall said that his life was an evil life, if he must lie there in outlawry, and be shaken and beaten withal if aught went amiss.Grettir asked Illugi what rede there was for the matter, but he said he could see none, but that they should abidethere till some keel should be brought thither: Grettir said it was but blindness to hope for that. \"Rather will I risk whether I may not come aland.\"\"Much my mind misgives me thereof,\" said Illugi, \"for we are all lost if thou comest to any ill.\"\"I shall not be swallowed up swimming,\" said Grettir; \"but henceforward I shall trust the thrall the worse for this, so much as lies hereon.\"Now the shortest way to the mainland from the island was a sea-mile long."}}
