Grettir misdoubted him, and had his weapons by his side night and day, nor durst Grim attack him while he was awake.But one morning whenas Grim came in from fishing, he went into the hut and stamped with his foot, and would know whether Grettir slept, but he started in nowise, but lay still; and the short-sword hung up over Grettir's head.Now Grim thought that no better chance would happen, so he made a great noise, that Grettir might chide him therefor, if he were awake, but that befell not. Now he thought that Grettir must surely be asleep, so he went stealthily up to the bed and reached out for the short-sword, and took it down, and unsheathed it. But even therewith Grettir sprang up on to the floor, and caught the short-sword just as the other raised it aloft, and laid the other hand on Grim betwixt the shoulders, and cast him down with such a fall, that he was well-nigh stunned; \"Ah, such hast thou shown thyself,\" said he, \"though thou wouldest give me good hope of thee.\" Then he had a true story from him, and thereafter slew him.And now Grettir deemed he saw what it was to take in wood-folk, and so the winter wore; and nothing Grettir thought to be of more trouble than his dread of the dark."}}
