Sigurd spake now, "Sure no wiser woman than thou art one may befound in the wide world; yea, yea, teach me more yet of thywisdom!"She answers, "Seemly is it that I do according to thy will, andshow thee forth more redes of great avail, for thy prayer's sakeand thy wisdom ;" and she spake withal --"Be kindly to friend and kin, and reward not their trespassesagainst thee; bear and forbear, and win for thee thereby longenduring praise of men."Take good heed of evil things: a may's love, and a man's wife;full oft thereof doth ill befall!"Let not thy mind be overmuch crossed by unwise men at throngedmeetings of folk; for oft these speak worse than they wot of;lest thou be called a dastard, and art minded to think that thouart even as is said; slay such an one on another day, and soreward his ugly talk."If thou farest by the way whereas bide evil things, be well wareof thyself; take not harbour near the highway, though thou bebenighted, for oft abide there ill wights for men's bewilderment. "Let not fair women beguile thee, such as thou mayst meet at thefeast, so that the thought thereof stand thee in stead of sleep,and a quiet mind; yea, draw them not to thee with kisses or othersweet things of love."If thou hearest the fool's word of a drunken man, strive notwith him being drunk with drink and witless; many a grief, yea,and the very death, groweth from out such things."Fight thy foes in the field, nor be burnt in thine house.'Never swear thou wrongsome oath; great and grim is the rewardfor the breaking of plighted troth."Give kind heed to dead men, -- sick-dead, Sea-dead, or ~word-dead; deal heedfully with their dead corpses."Trow never in him for whom thou hast slain father, brother, orwhatso near kin, yea, though young he be; `for oft waxes wolf inyoungling'."Look thou with good heed to the wiles of thy friends; but littleskill is given to me, that I should foresee the ways of thy life;yet good it were that hate fell not on thee from those of thywife's house."Sigurd spake, "None among the sons of men can be found wiser thanthou; and thereby swear I, that thee will I have as my own, fornear to my heart thou liest."She answers, "Thee would I fainest choose, though I had all men'ssons to choose from."And thereto they plighted troth both of them.
