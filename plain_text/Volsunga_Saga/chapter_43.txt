Now telleth the tale concerning the sons of Gudrun, that she hadarrayed their war-raiment in such wise, that no steel would bitethereon; and she bade them play not with stones or other heavymatters, for that it would be to their scathe if they did so.And now, as they went on their way, they met Erp, their brother,and asked him in what wise he would help them.He answered, "Even as hand helps hand, or foot helps foot."But that they deemed naught at all, and slew him there and then.Then they went their ways, nor was it long or ever Hamdirstumbled, and thrust down his hand to steady himself, and spaketherewith --"Naught but a true thing spake Erp, for now should I have fallen,had not hand been to steady me." A little after Sorli stumbled, but turned about on his feet, andso stood, and spake --"Yea now had I fallen, but that I steadied myself with bothfeet."And they said they had done evilly with Erp their brother.But on they fare till they come to the abode of King Jormunrek,and they went up to him and set on him forthwith, and Hamdir cutboth hands from him and Sorli both feet.  Then spake Hamdir --"Off were the head if Erp were alive; our brother whom we slew onthe way, and found out our deed too late."  Even as the Songsays, --"Off were the headIf Erp were alive yet,Our brother the bold,Whom we slew by the way,The well-famed in warfare."Now in this must they turn away from the words of their mother,whereas they had to deal with stones.  For now men fell on them,and they defended themselves in good and manly wise, and were thescathe of many a man, nor would iron bite on them.But there came thereto a certain man, old of aspect and one-eyed,(1) and he spake --"No wise men are ye, whereas ye cannot bring these men to theirend."Then the king said, "Give us rede thereto, if thou canst."He said, "Smite them to the death with stones."In such wise was it done, for the stones flew thick and fast fromevery side, and that was the end of their life-days.And now has come to an end the whole root and stem of theGiukings. (2)NOW MAY ALL EARLSBE BETTERED IN MIND,MAY THE GRIEF OF ALL MAIDENSEVER BE MINISHED,FOR THIS TALE OF TROUBLESO TOLD TO ITS ENDING.
