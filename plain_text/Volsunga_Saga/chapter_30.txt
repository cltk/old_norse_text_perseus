Thereafter Brynhild went out, and sat under her bower-wall, andhad many words of wailing to say, and still she cried that allthings were loathsome to her, both land and lordship alike, soshe might not have Sigurd.But therewith came Gunnar to her yet again, and Brynhild spake,"Thou shalt lose both realm and wealth, and thy life and me, forI shall fare home to my kin, and abide there in sorrow, unlessthou slayest Sigurd and his son; never nourish thou a wolfcub."Gunnar grew sick at heart thereat, and might nowise see whatfearful thing lay beneath it all; he was bound to Sigurd by oath,and this way and that way swung the heart within him; but at thelast he bethought him of the measureless shame if his wife wentfrom him, and he said within himself, "Brynhild is better to methan all things else, and the fairest woman of all women, and Iwill lay down my life rather than lose the love of her."  Andherewith he called to him his brother and spake, --"Trouble is heavy on me," and he tells him that he must needsslay Sigurd, for that he has failed him where in he trusted him;"so let us be lords of the gold and the realm withal."Hogni answers, "Ill it behoves us to break our oaths with wrackand wrong, and withal great aid we have in him; no kings shall beas great as we, if so be the King of the Hun-folk may live; suchanother brother-in-law never may we get again; bethink thee howgood it is to have such a brother-in-law, and such sons to oursister!  But well I see how things stand, for this has Brynhildstirred thee up to, and surely shall her counsel drag us intohuge shame and scathe."Gunnar says, "Yet shall it be brought about: and, lo, a redethereto; -- let us egg on our brother Guttorm to the deed; he isyoung, and of little knowledge, and is clean out of all the oathsmoreover.""Ah, set about in ill wise," says Hogni, "and though indeed itmay well be compassed, a due reward shall we gain for thebewrayal of such a man as is Sigurd."Gunnar says, "Sigurd shall die, or I shall die."And therewith he bids Brynhild arise and be glad at heart: so shearose, and still ever she said that Gunnar should come no moreinto her bed till the deed was done.So the brothers fall to talk, and Gunnar says that it is a deedwell worthy of death, that taking of Brynhild's maidenhead; "Socome now, let us prick on Guttorm to do the deed."Therewith they call him to them, and offer him gold and greatdominion, as they well have might to do.  Yea, and they took acertain worm and somewhat of wolf's flesh and let seethe themtogether, and gave him to eat of the same, even as the singersings --"Fish of the wild-wood,Worm smooth crawling,With wolf-meat mingled,They minced for Guttorm;Then in the beaker,In the wine his mouth knew,They set it, still doingMore deeds of wizards.Wherefore with the eating of this meat he grew so wild and eager,and with all things about him, and with the heavy words ofGrimhild, that he gave his word to do the deed; and mighty honourthey promised him in reward thereof.But of these evil wiles naught at all knew Sigurd, for he mightnot deal with his shapen fate, nor the measure of his life-days,neither deemed he that he was worthy such things at their hands.So Guttorm went in to Sigurd the next morning as he lay upon hisbed, yet durst he not do aught against him, but shrank back outagain; yea, and even so he fared a second time, for so bright andeager were the eyes of Sigurd that few durst look upon him.  Butthe third time he went in, and there lay Sigurd asleep; thenGuttorm drew his sword and thrust Sigurd through in such wisethat the sword point smote into the bed beneath him; then Sigurdawoke with that wound, and Guttorm gat him unto the door; buttherewith Sigurd caught up the sword Gram, and cast it after him,and it smote him on the back, and struck him asunder in themidst, so that the feet of him fell one way, and the head andhands back into the chamber.Now Gudrun lay asleep on Sigurd's bosom, but she woke up unto woethat may not be told of, all swimming in the blood of him, and insuch wise did she bewail her with weeping and words of sorrow,that Sigurd rose up on the bolster, and spake."Weep not," said he, "for thy brothers live for thy delight; buta young son have I, too young to be ware of his foes; and an illturn have these played against their own fortune; for never willthey get a mightier brother-in-law to ride abroad with them; nay,nor a better son to their sister, than this one, if he may growto man's estate.  Lo, now is that come to pass which was foretoldme long ago, but from mine eyes has it been hidden, for none mayfight against his fate and prevail.  Behold this has Brynhildbrought to pass, even she who loves me before all men; but thismay I swear, that never have I wrought ill to Gunnar, but ratherhave ever held fast to my oath with him, nor was I ever too mucha friend to his wife.  And now if I had been forewarned, and hadbeen afoot with my weapons, then should many a man have lost hislife or ever I had fallen, and all those brethren should havebeen slain, and a harder work would the slaying of me have beenthan the slaying of the mightiest bull or the mightiest boar ofthe wild-wood."And even therewithal life left the King; but Gudrun moaned anddrew a weary breath, and Brynhild heard it and laughed when sheheard her moaning.Then said Gunnar, "Thou laughest not because thy heart-roots aregladdened, or else why doth thy visage wax so wan?  Sure an evilcreature thou art; most like thou art nigh to thy death!  Lo now,how meet would it be for thee to behold thy brother Atli slainbefore thine eyes, and that thou shouldst stand over him dead;whereas we must needs now stand over our brother-in-law in such acase our brother-in-law and our brother's bane."She answered, "None need mock at the measure of slaughter beingunfulfilled; yet heedeth not Atli your wrath or your threats;yea, he shall live longer than ye, and be a mightier man."Hogni spake and said, "Now hath come to pass the soothsaying ofBrynhild; an ill work not to be atoned for."And Gudrun said, "My kinsmen have slain my husband; but ye, whenye next ride to the war and are come into the battle, then shallye look about and see that Sigurd is neither on the fight handnor the left, and ye shall know that he was your good-hap andyour strength; and if he had lived and had sons, then should yehave been strengthened by his offspring and his kin."
