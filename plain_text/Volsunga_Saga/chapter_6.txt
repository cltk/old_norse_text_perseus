Now whenas Sigmund is loosed and the stocks are broken, he dwellsin the woods and holds himself there; but Signy sends yet againto wot of the tidings, whether Sigmund were alive or no; but whenthose who were sent came to him, he told them all as it hadbetid, and how things had gone betwixt him and the wolf; so theywent home and tell Signy the tidings; but she goes and finds herbrother, and they take counsel in such wise as to make a houseunderground in the wild-wood; and so things go on a while, Signyhiding him there, and sending him such things as he needed; butKing Siggeir deemed that all the Volsungs were dead.Now Siggeir had two sons by his wife, whereof it is told thatwhen the eldest was ten winters old, Signy sends him to Sigmund,so that he might give him help, if he would in any wise strive toavenge his father; so the youngling goes to the wood, and comeslate in evening-tide to Sigmund's earth-house; and Sigmundwelcomed him in seemly fashion, and said that he should makeready their bread; "But I," said he, "will go seek firewood."Therewith he gives the meal-bag into his hands while he himselfwent to fetch firing; but when he came back the youngling haddone naught at the bread-making.  Then asks Sigmund if the breadbe ready -- Says the youngling, "I durst not set hand to the meal sack,because somewhat quick lay in the meal."Now Sigmund deemed he wotted that the lad was of no such heart asthat he would be fain to have him for his fellow; and when he methis sister, Sigmund said that he had come no nigher to the aid ofa man though the youngling were with him.Then said Signy, "Take him and kill him then; for why should suchan one live longer?" and even so he did.So this winter wears, and the next winter Signy sent her next sonto Sigmund; and there is no need to make a long tale thereof, forin like wise went all things, and he slew the child by thecounsel of Signy.
